        Hibernate model infrastructure objects.

        Note that all model classes and methods are delibrately kept as not final. This is so Hibernate is able to proxy the classes for lazy loading
        functionality.

        In additon, (due to non-final methods only), please also ensure you DO NOT override methdos from @link
        com.andreweells.persistence.insfrastructure.AbstractPersistentObject, these methods are meant to be final.
