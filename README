One of the main drivers behind this project was to provide a standardised, not to mention limiting, approach to 
data access, and to raise awareness by profiling of what is going on under the hood.

So you'll notice there's no option to submit a String query, something that might give you confidence depending on your
team's proficiency with databases.

The profiling is also a simple way to view behaviour in an environment beyond development where indexing becomes much
more prevalent and obvious.


I think it'd be possible to write a nicer DSL than Hibernate's DetachedCriteria also if anyone would like to fork.

queryFor(Account.class).with("surname", "Smith").with("enabled", true).sortAsc("email").build();

reads better than the following and would have the benefit of further Hibernate abstraction:

DetachedCriteria.forClass(Account.class)
  .add(Restrictions.eq("surname", "Smith")
  .add(Restrictions.eq("enabled", true))
  .addSort(Order.asc("email"));
